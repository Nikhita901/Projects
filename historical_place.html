          <h2>TAJ MAHAL</h2>
          <p>
            Taj Mahal is located in<b> Agra</b>, a city in Uttar Pradesh. This
            famous monument is situated on the banks of the river Yamuna. Taj
            Mahal was built in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Taj Mahal
            is made of white marble. The monument is one of the seven wonders of
            the world. Taj Mahal is essentially a tomb built in the memory of
            Shah Jahan's wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Taj Mahal is also famous as the
            symbol of love. The popular dome and the pillars around the Taj
            Mahal are common in medieval Mughal architecture. In 1982, the Taj
            Mahal was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

            The Qutab Minar was the first building constructed in the<b
              >delhi</b
            >

            Indo-Islamic style. Its construction started during the reign of
            Qutb ud din Aibak, the founder of the Sultanate. It was later
            completed during the reign of Iltutmish. A tall tower and balconies
            projecting from it are the prominent features of this building.The
            Qutub Minar, also spelled "Qutb Minar," was built in 1192 by
            Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the first Sultan and first Muslim ruler of Delhi,
            and was completed in 1368 by Firoz Shah Tughlaq.

          <h2>RED FORT</h2>
          <p>
            Everyone knows about the Red Fort in <b>Delhi</b> we all watch the
            Prime Minister's speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th
            August every year. As a child, I remember watching it on television
            with Doordarshan's cameras spanning around and giving a glimpse of
            Chandni Chowk opposite it. I first visited it when I was in the
            sixth standard and my parents took us to see the famous Delhi and
            Agra circuit. I do not remember much from that visit and I think I
            was fairly confused between the Red Fort of Agra and Delhi. Years
            later, my first job took me to Delhi.
